**Configuration**: All models used prediction length of 64 timesteps, starting context length of 80 timesteps, evaluated on 6 in-distribution and 5 out-of-distribution samples.

### Finetuning Results

Performance of finetuned models on the same heat flux prediction task.

300 flux trace simulations were at our disposal. For the following experiments 49 traces were filtered out due to time series head and tail means not being between 1 and inf.
The remaining 251 samples were sub-sampled from 800 timesteps to 266 (every 3rd timestep) to resemble the benchmark time series as closely as possible.
For finetuning autogluon samples a custom validation set from the training data. This validation set consists of timeseries where the [:-prediction_length] tail is used for validation and hyperparameter tuning.
I created a routine to manually provide a validation set by sampling the training set timeseries in a stratified manner. This is achieved by assigning each time series to a bin depending on the time series mean.
However, since also with this approach only the last prediction tail is used for validation and we want to predict time series from timestep 80 onwards I changed the validation window and step size config to num_val_windows=2 and val_step_size=64. Using this the model is evaluated on the following time series sub-intervals:
> ctx 58 | pred 80 = 142
> ctx 58 + 64 | pred 80 = 182
> ctx 58 + 64 + 64 | pred 80 = 266

Providing a separate tuning_data as validation set during training enables the model to also learn the last prediction_length timesteps during training, otherwise the last prediction_length timesteps are only used for validation, not for training.
In the current setting, the model learns ONLY to predict the last prediction_length timesteps - so context length 186 is used as history and then trained to forecast the next 80 timesteps. In order to make the model also learn prior patterns in flux traces, I need to manually window the data and remove the num_val_windows and val_step_size parameters again.

To increase the amount of training data, I subsampled each flux trace three times with a distance of three timesteps.
